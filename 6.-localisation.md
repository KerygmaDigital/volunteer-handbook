# 6. Localisation

The Localisation of our products is key to reaxhing a wider audience around the world. Your job is to translate the products provided by Kerygma Digital through [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/).

## 6.1. Using CrowdIn


## 6.2. Roles
The localisation department can be split into two distinct roles. The Localisation Specialist and the Localisation Coordinator. Both are equally vital to the translation and the accuracy thereof.

### 6.2.1. Localisation Specialist


### 6.2.2. Localisation Coordinator
When there are multiple Localisation Specialists for the same language, one of them is to be appointed Localisation Coordinator. The Localisation Coordinator, on top of normal translation work, checks the translation work put forth by the other Localisation Specialists on accuracy, and approves them.
