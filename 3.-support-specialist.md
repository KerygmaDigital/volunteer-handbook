# 3. Support Specialist
As a Support specialist, you are here to help out our users in need. It is necessary to have an understanding of the systems and practices you are to work with in order to help the end user to the best of your ability. In this chapter, it will be discussed what to do navigate the ticket system, etiquette surrounding end user support, escalations, and common issues that you may encounter. 


## 3.1. The Ticket System
The ticket system is set up in order to privately and conveniently help a user with any issues that may arise. <!-- BugBug: ***NEEDS MORE TEXT BEFORE GOING LIVE.*** -->

### 3.1.1. Opening a Ticket
Usually, the support staff is not the one who opens a ticket, but it does happenin some cases, for example, a training scenario for a new Support Specialist in a controlled environment.  
When a ticket is opened, a few things happen. A new channel is created and named `ticket`, followed by a four digit number. An example would be the most recent ticket, which is, as of writing, `ticket-0339`. Within this channel, a message will appear that, at the top of the message will consist of an @mention of the Support Specialist role, and an @mention of the person who opened the ticket. Below this line will be an embed with a tagline that reads `<product> support`, with an image of the product's logo to the right, and under it the text "your ticket has been created, an @üè° Support Specialist will be with you momentarily." Underneath this will be a sentence aimed towards the end user about reading the Frequently Asked Questions, as well as a possible notice if applicable. a full demonstration embed can be found in *[Figure 3-1.: An Example of an Embed Taken From the BibleBot Server](./3.-support-specialist.md#figure-3-1-an-example-of-an-embed-taken-from-the-biblebot-server)*.

###### *Figure 3-1.: An Example of an Embed Taken From the BibleBot Server*

Notice that below this embed are two buttons, one closing the ticket, and one for claiming it.

### 3.1.2. Claiming and Unclaiming a Ticket
To avoid multiple Support Specialists from talking over each other in the ticket, it is wise to claim it. Claiming the ticket is done by clicking the "Claim" buutton under the initial message as depicted in [Figure 3-1](./3.-support-specialist.md#figure-3-1-an-example-of-an-embed-taken-from-the-biblebot-server). Other Specialists may still view the ticket and advise on the course of action regardless of the ticket's claimed status.

#### 3.1.2.1. Unclaiming a Ticket
Unclaiming a ticket is done, for example, when one needs a peer to take over due to an outside factor, such as a family emergency, or other urgent matter. To unclaim a ticket, simply press the "Claim" button again. Please notify a peer if the situation requires a peer or director to take over.

### 3.1.3. New Ticket Etiquette
Once a ticket has been claimed, greet the end user, this can be done either formally or informally, examples of which will be demonstrated later in sections [3.1.3.1.](./3.-support-specialist.md#3131-example-of-a-formal-greeting) and [3.1.3.2.](./3.-support-specialist.md#3132-example-of-a-less-formal-greeting)

After the greeting, await the user's response and answer the questions in a proffesional and polite manner.

##### 3.1.3.1. Example of a Formal Greeting
An example of a considerate yet formal greeting could be:
> Good time zone, how may I help you?

In this greeting, the unknown variables, such as timezone, are embraced, allowing for a fitting greeting regardless of time of day or time zone differences.
The phrase `time zone` may be substituted for `day`, both are equally valid.

#### 3.1.3.2. Example of a Less Formal Greeting
Now that a formal example has been given, an informal one is all that remains. A demonstration of a less formal greeting could be:
> Hello, how may I help you?

#### 3.1.3.3. Choosing the Right Greeting
An advantage of a more formal greeting radiates professionalism and ability, while a less formal one shows approachability and care. In conclusion, neither is superior to the other. The Support Specialist may use their discretion on the formality of their greetings. <!-- Needs rephrasing. -->
