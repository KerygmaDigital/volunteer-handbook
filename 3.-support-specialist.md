# 3. Support Specialist
As a Support specialist, you are here to help out our users in need. It is necessary to have an understanding of the systems and practices you are to work with in order to help the end user to the best of your ability. In this chapter, it will be discussed what to do navigate the ticket system, etiquette surrounding end user support, escalations, and common issues that you may encounter. 


## 3.1. The Ticket System
The ticket system is set up in order to privately and conveniently help a user with any issues that may arise. ***NEEDS MORE TEXT BEFORE GOING LIVE***

### 3.1.1. Opening a Ticket
Usually, the support staff is not the one who opens a ticket, but it does happenin some cases, for example, a training scenario for a new Support Specialist in a controlled environment.  
When a ticket is opened, a few things happen. A new channel is created and named `ticket`, followed by a four digit number. An example would be the most recent ticket, which is, as of writing, `ticket-0339`. Within this channel, a message will appear that, at the top of the message will consist of an @mention of the Support Specialist role, and an @mention of the person who opened the ticket. Below this line will be an embed with a tagline that reads `<product> support`, with an image of the product's logo to the right, and under it the text "your ticket has been created, an @üè° Support Specialist will be with you momentarily." Underneath this will be a sentence aimed towards the end user about reading the Frequently Asked Questions, as well as a possible notice if applicable. a full demonstration embed can be found in *[Figure 3.1.: An Example of an Embed Taken From the BibleBot Server](./3.-support-specialist.md#figure-31-an-example-of-an-embed-taken-from-the-biblebot-server)*.
