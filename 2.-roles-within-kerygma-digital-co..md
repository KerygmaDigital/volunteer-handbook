# 2. Roles within Kerygma Digital Co.
At our organisation, many roles are needed to keep everything running smoothly. What each of those roles are, will be explained here.

All roles can be divided in 5 categories, these categories are: community, engineering, licensing, localisation, and support. Each of these branches has get their own chapter, explaining what the functions do, and wha their procedures are. Support, for example, has a portion explaining [the ticket system](), and Localization Coordinator will have a guide on how to [approve or reject translations]() on CrowdIn.

## 2.1. Community
The community side of the die include the moderation of our social media platforms, as well as creating blog articles, spawning discourse, and representing the company in the public eye.

## 2.2. Engineering
At the heart of Kerygma Digital Co. stand the software engineers that help make all of our products a reality. Without them, the rest cannot do their job.

## 2.3. Licensing
The Licensing division makes sure our paperwork is in order. For BibleBot, for example, they  are the ones that reach out to publishers to get their permission to use bible translations.

## 2.4. Localisation
The localisation team is essential to help our products reach a wider audience. Without them, our products would be in English and in English only, underserving a massive percentage of the world's population.

## 2.5. Support
At the backbone of user to developer interaction, these volunteers have an intimate knowledge of our products, and are there to provide help to those who need it.
