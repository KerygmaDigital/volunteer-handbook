# 1. Introduction
Within Kerygma Digital Co., there are many volunteers, like you everywhere in the world, working together around the clock to keep our organisation going. Due to an overall rise in volunteers over the past year, we, the directory, decided to write a handbook to record the standards, practices, and conventions within the team.

This first edition will cover the bases of every volunteering position within the organisation. It will hopefully be everything you need to fulfill your position to the best of your abilities.
