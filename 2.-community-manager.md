# 2. Community Manager

The Community Manager focuses on the moderation of the communities of the products and services Kerygma Digital provides. As one, you must be able to make independent decisions, as well as work in a team to respond to and resolve a situation. To achieve this, there are various tools at your disposal. These tools will be explained in [3.1. Diakonos Commands](#31-diakonos-commands). The rest of this chapter will consist of procedures and guidelines for warnings, bans, and mutes.

## 2.1. Diakonos Commands
Diakaonos, the in-house moderation bot has a few commands useful for moderation. These are `.mute`, `.warn`, `.ban` `.permaban` and `.kick`. Most are fairly simple to use, but especially the `.warn` command has a few quirks that can make it rather confusing.

### 2.1.1. `.mute`, `.kick`, `.permaban` and `.ban`
The usage of the mute, kick and ban commands are fairly simple. You simply type
> `.kick [@user] [reason]`  
> `.ban [@user] [reason]`

Or  
> `.permaban [@user] [reason]`  

#### 2.1.1.1. Muting
The  `.mute` command is a little more complex, as it has the option to temporarily mute people. To mute someone, use
> `.mute [@user] [reason]`

To temporarily mute someone, use
> `.mute [@user] [timespan] [reason]`

This time interval can be in seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks. The abbreviations for these are
> `s` - seconds  
> `m` - minutes  
> `d` - days  
> `w`- weeks  

An example of muting someone for 5 hours would be
> `.mute @PeterPE128#9020 5h Asked to be muted`

To unmute someone manually, you can use
> `.unmute [@user] [reason]`

### 2.1.2. The Warning System
The principle of the warning system is rather easy. It works not unlike the commands above.
> `.warn [@user] [reason]`

But the relative difficulty lies in its point system. Although, Although a single point warning is sufficient in most cases, not all warnings issued are equal, and the points system reflects this. These points stack with each warning issued, making subsequent warnings a greater punishment. Here follows an overview of what each warning means
> 1 - On the first warning, not much happens, it is just a warning.  
> 2 - On a second warning, the user is kicked.  
> 3 - After the third warning is issued, the warned user is banned for a day.  
> 4 - The fourth warning causes the warned to be temporarily banned for a week.  
> 5 - On a fifth warning, the user is temp banned for a month.  
>  6 - A sixth and final warning leads to a permanent ban from the server. [[2.1](./7.-sources-and-references.md#21)]

To hand out a multiple point warning, use
> `.warn [@user] [points] [reason]`

A practical example would be
> `.warn @PeterPE128#9020 2 Disruptive behaviour`

We do realise that mistakes happen, that is why we present: `.unwarn`. `.unwarn` behaves much like `.unmute`.
> `.unwarn [@user] [warning ID] [reason]`

The warning ID can be acquired from the case entry.

### 2.1.3. Cases
Every warning, mute, unmute, ban, unban, kick, and unwarn are assigned a case number. As of writing, there are 445 cases on record. To view an individual case, use
> `.case [number]`

Example:
>`.case 100`


There is also an option to view cases for a specific user. This can be achieved using the `.casesfor` command. The command can be used as follows:
> `.casesfor @PeterPE128`

### 2.1.4. User Information
An overview of user information can be viewed with the `.userinfo` command. This should show the user's status, the username, the nickname, a profile picture, followed by some information on the account, namely, the age and when the user joined the server. After the server join date, the roles are listed, after which the previous nicknames, and badges are shown. At the bottom, it shows what the member count was when the user joined, and the user's ID.

#### 2.1.4.1. User ID
The user ID is a very useful bit of information that can be used with all the commands listed above. We recognise it is rare that you need to use

##### 2.1.4.1.1. Finding the User ID
The way a user ID us acquired differs between the mobile and desktop/web versions of Discord.

###### 2.1.4.1.1.1. On Computer
To find the user ID, Developer Mode must be enabled on Discord. To enable this, go to settings and select the `Advanced` menu.

To get the ID on computer, make sure Developer Mode is enabled, then hover over the profile picture with the mouse, and click with the secondary mouse button, often the right button, this can also be achieved by clicking with two fingers on a trackpad or Apple Mouse. In the menu that appears, select `Copy ID`.

###### 2.1.4.1.1.2. On Mobile
On phone, tap on the user to see their profile, then tap the `...` in the top-right corner of the profile, and select `copy ID`.

#### 2.1.4.2. Using the User ID
As mentioned above, the User ID is rarely used. A few cases in which it _is_ used are, for example
* The User is wrongly banned, and is to be unbanned.
* The User is evading a ban by leaving the server.
* You want to be absolutely sure you are banning the right person.
* You want to warn a user in a channel that doesn't allow the user to read its messages.

The uses for the user ID are therefore rather straight-forward in usage. To use a command with a User ID, for example `.unban`, use
`.unban [User ID] [reason]`

If a user is ban-evading, please inform a director and let them deal with it. Supplying the Directors with an ID, however, is something that is completely fine, as It makes their task easier. More on when to call on the directory can be found in [3.3. Guidelines](#33-guidelines).

### 2.1.5. Image Permissions
*This is mostly relevant to those without Two-Factor Authentication. For more information on Two-Factor Authentication, check out [this article from Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication).*

The servers of our products don't allow everyone to embed links or post media like documents, images, or videos. To allow the people to send these, a separate role is required. You can assign this manually, unless you have Two-Factor Authentication disabled on your account. To allow the Community Managers without Two-Factor Authentication to assign and remove the image and link permission role, two commands were created: `.giveimg` and `.takeimg`. These commands work much like `.mute`, although they do not allow for a time limit on the role. The proper uses for the commands are
> `.giveimg [@user]`

And
> `.takeimg [@user]`

## 2.2. The Rules
In order to uphold the rules, you must know them. Fortunately, the Discord servers for our products have the rules in them. These rule lists are your best friend in regards to moderating specific situations, they are always something to re-review and fall back on. Although there may be specific differences between communities, the general rules are
> 1. Respect all people regardless of sex, age, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, sexual orientation, and gender identity.
> 2. No swearing or crude joking.
> 3. No political discussion.
> 4. No denominational bickering or triumphalism, we're all siblings in Christ here.
> 5. No inappropriate content. This includes spamming, advertising, mass pinging, and NSFW material.
> 6. Excessive insincerity is forbidden.
> 7. Keep things generally on topic, take strictly 1-on-1 conversations to DMs.
> 8. Alternate accounts are forbidden. You may only have one account on this server at any given time. Exceptions can be made upon request no more than 3 times.
> 9. Antisemitism, racism, ethnic segregationism, or ethnic supremacism is not tolerated and will result in a permanent ban. Any surrogates for these ideologies, such as fascism, nazism, ethnic nationalism, derivatives of the aforementioned, or apparent dog whistles to these ideologies are not tolerated in the same manner.
> 10. No minimodding. If you have any concerns, ping a __Community Manager__ or the __Community Director__.

## 2.3. Guideliness 
In this part, the general guidelines for punishments are laid out. Although we recognise most situations can be dealt with through a verbal warning, or even a `.warn`, there are some exceptions to this.

### 2.3.1. Definitions
There will be some terms used throughout this portion of the handbook that may be ambiguous in nature, that is why the terms are defined here.
* Verbal warning - A verbal warning is informing the user that their behaviour is unfit for this community, and that further action will be taken if they continue.
* Written warning - a written warning means a warning on record. Recorded through the `.warn` command.
* NSFW - NSFW or Not Safe For Work includes sexual content and content involving excessive gore. A good guideline on whether content is NSFW is "If you would not feel comfortable opening it in public, it is generally considered NSFW."

### 2.3.2. LGBTQIA+ Discussions.
Any discussions regarding the LGBTQIA+ Community, on any side, are to be shot down with the `.lgbt` command built into Diakonos. This will send a notice reminding those involved that this community is not the place to discuss this matter. If the user(s) continue, hand out a verbal warning. If the belligerents do not cease their activity, hand out a written warning. 

Try to stop these discussions, regardless if they align with your personal views or not. Everyone in the community has the same right to be part of it.

### 2.3.3. Arguments Using the Scriptures
If someone tries to actively antagonise another user or group of people using an array of scripture in one message, you may either hand out a verbal warning, or, in some cases use the following, available [here](https://discord.com/channels/362503610006765568/789643945000828939/863811030161293342).
> ```I am <Ex 6:7 RSV> just as <Gen 26:29 RSV> capable <Wis 8:15 RSV> of <2 Sam 23:2 RSV> taking <Lev 3:9 RSV> things <Num 4:20 RSV> out of <Gen 47:30 RSV> its <Ex 30:18 RSV> con <Gen 8:5 RSV> text <Lk 20:17 NRSV>``` [[2.2](./7.-sources-and-references.md#22)]

### 2.3.4. Violations of Rule 9
Violations involving Rule 9 warrant the usage of `.permaban`. Please specify what specifically warranted the usage of `.permaban` instead of simply stating "Rule 9."
A proper example of how one should use `.permaban` in this situation would be
> `.permaban [@user] Mein Kampf quote in About Me section`

Or
> `.permaban [@user] COVID-19 vaccination papers aren't the same as the yellow Star-of-David sow-on patches that were handed out by the nazis.`

### 2.3.5. Spam, Trolling, and excessive NSFW content
If one uses excessive spam, NSFW or insincerity, a 2 point warning should suffice. Be sure to clean up, or ask for help cleaning up from your peers if you deem it necessary.

### 2.3.6. Uncertainty
If you are uncertain about a situation and you would like second opinion, or the situation is devolving beyond your control, please call on the Community Director. If the Community Director is not online, contact the other Directors.
