# 3. Community Manager

The Community Manager focuses on the moderation of the communities of the products and services Kerygma Digital provides. As one, you must be able to make independent decisions, as well as work in a team to respond to and resolve a situation. To achieve this, there are various tools at your disposal. These tools will be explained in [3.1. Diakonos Commands](#31-diakonos-commands). The rest of this chapter will consist of procedures and guidelines for warnings, bans, and mutes.

## 3.1. Diakonos Commands
Diakaonos, the in-house moderation bot has a few commands useful for moderation. These are `.mute`, `.warn`, `.ban` `.permaban` and `.kick`. Most are fairly simple to use, but especially the `.warn` command has a few quirks that can make it rather confusing.

### 3.1.1. `.mute`, `.kick`, `.permaban` and `.ban`
The usage of the mute, kick and ban commands are fairly simple. You simply type
> `.kick [@user] [reason]`  
> `.ban [@user] [reason]`

Or  
> `.permaban [@user] [reason]`  

#### 3.1.1.1. Muting
The  `.mute` command is a little more complex, as it has the option to temporarily mute people. To mute someone, use
> `.mute [@user] [reason]`

To temporarily mute someone, use
> `.mute [@user] [timespan] [reason]`

This time interval can be in seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks. The abbreviations for these are
> `s` - seconds  
> `m` - minutes  
> `d` - days  
> `w`- weeks  

An example of muting someone for 5 hours would be
> `.mute @PeterPE128#9020 5h Asked to be muted`

To unmute someone manually, you can use
> `.unmute [@user] [reason]`

### 3.1.2. The Warning System
The principle of the warning system is rather easy. It works not unlike the commands above.
> `.warn [@user] [reason]`

But the relative difficulty lies in its point system. Although, Although a single point warning is sufficient in most cases, not all warnings issued are equal, and the points system reflects this. These points stack with each warning issued, making subsequent warnings a greater punishment. Here follows an overview of what each warning means
> 1 - On the first warning, not much happens, it is just a warning.  
> 2 - On a second warning, the user is kicked.  
> 3 - After the third warning is issued, the warned user is banned for a day.  
> 4 - The fourth warning causes the warned to be temporarily banned for a week.  
> 5 - On a fifth warning, the user is temp banned for a month.  
>  6 - A sixth and final warning leads to a permanent ban from the server. [3.1](./8.-sources-and-references.md#31)

To hand out a multiple point warning, use
> `.warn [@user] [points] [reason]`

A practical example would be
> `.warn @PeterPE128#9020 2 Disruptive behaviour`

We do realise that mistakes happen, that is why we present: `.unwarn`. `.unwarn` behaves like `.unmute`.
> `.unwarn [@user] [reason]`

### 3.1.3. Cases
Every warning, mute, unmute, ban, unban, kick, and unwarn are assigned a case number. As of writing, there are 445 cases on record. To view an individual case, use
> `.case [number]`

Example:
>`.case 100`

There is also an option to view cases for a specific user. This can be achieved using the `.casesfor` command. The command can be used as follows:
> `.casesfor @PeterPE128`

### 3.1.4. User Information
An overview of user information can be viewed with the `.userinfo` command. This should show the user's status, the username, the nickname, a profile picture, followed by some information on the account, namely, the age and when the user joined the server. After the server join date, the roles are listed, after which the previous nicknames, and badges are shown. At the bottom, it shows what the member count was when the user joined, and the user's ID.

#### 3.1.4.1. User ID
The user ID is a very useful bit of information that can be used with all the commands listed above. We recognise it is rare that you need to use

##### 3.1.4.1.1. Finding the User ID
The way a user ID us acquired differs between the mobile and desktop/web versions of Discord. 

###### 3.1.4.1.1.1. On Computer
To get the ID on computer, hover over the profile picture with the mouse, and click with the secondary mouse button, often the right button, this can also be achieved by clicking with two fingers on a trackpad or Apple Mouse. In the menu that appears, select `Copy ID`.

###### 3.1.4.1.1.2. On Mobile
On phone, tap on the user to see their profile, then tap the `...` in the top-right corner of the profile, and select `copy ID`.

#### 3.1.4.2. Using the User ID
As mentioned above, the User ID is rarely used. A few cases in which it _is_ used are, for example
* The User is wrongly banned, and is to be unbanned.
* The User is evading a ban by leaving the server.
* You want to be absolutely sure you are banning the right person.
* You want to warn a user in a channel that doesn't allow the user to read its messages.

The uses for the user ID are therefore rather straight-forward in usage. To use a command with a User ID, for example `.unban`, use
`.unban [User ID] [reason]`

If a user is ban-evading, please inform a director and let them deal with it. Supplying the Directors with an ID, however, is something that is completely fine, as It makes their task easier.
