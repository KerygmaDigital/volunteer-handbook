# 5. Software Engineer

Software engineering is the backbone of what we do here at Kerygma Digital. We specialize in open-source software and services using that software to serve Christians all around the world. This section will cover the ins and outs of our workflow, our tech stack, and any other tidbits.

## 5.1 Workflow

Kerygma Digital intends to operate in a pseudo-Agile manner. As for what "pseudo-Agile" entails, essentially we seek to deploy Agile software development methodology insofar as it's applicable to our organization and development. Being a volunteer organization, we have limitations that would hinder a fully Agile software development process, particularly when it comes to time commitments and working as a team.

The core of our workflow revolves around kanban boards. At its essence, kanban boards help us to keep track of what needs to be done, what is being worked on, and what is complete. Naturally, not every task on a kanban board has the same priority or scope. To supplement this, we utilize GitHub's issue labels to indicate various facets of a task. This isn't to say that we use one massive kanban board for all of Kerygma Digital or for a whole project, they are divided by various teams. As an example, BibleBot, as of writing, has two kanban boards, one for development and one for licensing.

Where we fall short in implementing a fully agile environment is that this is purely a volunteer operation. We do not expect (nor do we want) your work here to be a full-time job. This is a labor of love first and foremost. As a result of this, there are no such things as Scrum sprints. If it happens that we have the people and the time sync, maybe this is something we can organize more in the future.

### 5.1.1 Project Hierarchies

Of course, it is vital that we have a hierarchy in our projects to ensure a smooth running operation, for both you as well as for our users. It is a rather simple hierarchy, with only two substantial roles, that of the **Maintainer** and that of the **Engineer**.

#### 5.1.1.1 Maintainer

Maintainers are those who organize tasks, assign priorities, triage bugs, and any other organizational actions on a particular project. They also consult with other teams such as Licensing and Localization to cleanly integrate their work into our projects. Naturally, our maintainers are also engineers. If you need any sort of advice on what to work on next or proposing a new issue, consider seeking out a maintainer before checking the task board or making an issue on GitHub.

#### 5.1.1.2 Engineer

Engineers are the core of the team. They do the implementation, under the guidance and mentoring of a maintainer. All the same, our engineers are not code monkeys. Engineers are just as vital as our maintainers in providing various perspectives and working together to produce quality code and service. Maintainers nothing without engineers, just as engineers can only do so much without maintainers.

### 5.1.2 The Development Cycle

There are various ways that the development cycle can function, as much of it depends on the individual to do things in the way that makes the most sense to them. Of course, this comes with certain boundaries to ensure quality, but none that are too complicated or bureaucratic to impede progress.

Essentially, it comes down to taking on the correct tasks, following organizational practices, and being subjected to our code review process.

#### 5.1.2.1 Taking on Tasks

You have the liberty in choosing what tasks you desire working on, with certain caveats. It's important not to take on tasks that are already assigned to another engineer, as we do not want to overlap our work and create various conflicts. If you wish to work on a task that is already assigned to another engineer, consider reaching out to them or a maintainer to see if there is a way to incorporate you into the process.

#### 5.1.2.2 Organizational Practices

All the work of engineers should be done in a branch of the project that is **unique to that feature or bug fix**. These branches should not have random or arbitrary names like `develop` or `patch-1`, but rather should follow the convention of `username/brief-synopsis`. For example, if [SeraphimRP](https://github.com/SeraphimRP) was working on implementing reading plans, these changes should be made in the `srp/reading-plans` branch. Try to avoid making long synopses like `srp/fixing-that-bug-on-line-220-in-VerseController-dot-cs`.

Once your work is drafted well enough, submit a pull request to the `master` or `main` branch where you will undergo our code review process.

#### 5.1.2.3 Code Review

In the code review process, our maintainers will ensure that code follows our style guide, does not over-complicate itself, is optimized as well as it can be, and is complete. Once you implement any applicable corrections or adjustments, maintainers will sign off and merge it into the core branch accordingly.

### 5.1.3 The Development Environment

First and foremost, our projects are developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). While you are free and encouraged to use the editor you are most familiar with, ensure that you make your editing environment take into account things like snippets and linting with `.editorconfig` files.

Otherwise, your environment is entirely up to you. You know what works with you best. The only precaution in using a different editor is being sure to not push any editor-specific metadata beyond the standard `.vscode` folder. If you run into this issue, just list the offending directory in the `.gitignore` for that repository. You can also use something like [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io) to generate environment-specific additions so you do not mistakenly push these directories.

We will now move on into specifics about the development environment for our projects.

#### 5.1.3.1 BibleBot's Development Environment

Unique requirements about BibleBot's development environment is getting a local [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance running whilst developing and any applicable API keys (mainly the API.Bible key). MongoDB itself is free of charge, so do not panic about any of their paid offerings.  As for API keys, reach out to Seraphim (srp#0001) on Discord to obtain what is necessary.

Otherwise, the only things you will need is the [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). For most Linux users, take a look at [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux) for easier integration. Arch Linux users, you will only need to do `sudo pacman -S dotnet-sdk dotnet-runtime aspnet-runtime aspnet-targeting-pack`.

It is highly encouraged that you configure your environment to automatically detect and run tests in a manner integrated with your environment. For Visual Studio Code, we recommend using the [.NET Core Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.dotnet-test-explorer). Assuming you have the .NET SDK configured properly, it should be seamless.

Finally, bear in mind that most of the "secrets" (that is API keys, tokens, things like that) are done through environment variables. For Windows users, you will need to add these to the environment variables for your Windows account. For Linux users, we recommend using something like [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to conveniently handle environment variables using a `.envrc` file in the project root folder. If you use direnv, be sure to get the [direnv extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Rubymaniac.vscode-direnv) for Visual Studio Code, if that is your editor of choice. (Note: Windows users unfortunately are unable to use direnv as it is not functional enough yet.)

As for a Discord token for extended testing, you will be provided a unique internal instance of BibleBot that can be used in a sandboxed environment within the project server. We handle this end of things to ensure ultimate security and privacy in case something goes wrong.

##### 5.1.3.1.1 Testing

We highly encourage you building unit tests for any new functions and the sort. Ensuring our code is well tested ensures that we provide an excellent service. Be sure to check out the [NUnit documentation](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/intro.html) for more details on our unit-testing system. Besides that, tests are quite seamless to run, simply by running `dotnet test`. Alternatively, our continuous integration will run any tests it finds.

##### 5.1.3.1.2 Continuous Integration

All code changes needs to go through our continuous integration (CI) to make sure builds are successful and tests pass. For minor changes like README edits and other trivial things, include `[ci skip]` somewhere in your commit message to avoid triggering the CI. We recommend placing this line on a new line below the normal commit message so it only appears in the extended description.

We do not have CI enabled for branches besides the `master` branch, mainly to avoid confusion in builds. However, we do have them enabled for pull requests, so do not worry if you aren't seeing CI working on your branch.

## 5.2 Mentoring and Guidance

Here at Kerygma Digital, it's very important to us that our engineers receive the support and guidance they need. By all means, we encourage you to reach out to fellow engineers, maintainers, or the Lead Software Engineer (srp#0001) to get insight on an issue. We are a team and we want to help sharpen each other's skills, even if it happens to be minor issues. If you have any uncertainties or concerns, be sure to reach out!
